    "The Project Description required us to choose a data based on our own interests. After some thoughts I came up with the theme I now spend most time exploring about and one of the webpages I use for that purpose. As a senior year student I go a lot through the universities' webpages and usually as first step I check their rankings.\n",
    "<br>Therefore, after consideration of several rankings webpages, I chose probably the most famous - QS World Rankings, because it seemed to contain most of detailed information and statistics. Among all variations of rankings, for this project _\"QS World University Rankings 2021\"_ https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2021 was examined. \n",
    "<br>The webpages of each university contained number of different information and details. Considering the information available, in this project it was decided to focus on the proportions of the international students in the universities in different regions. After some considerations, as 3 domeneering regions USA, Europe and the rest of the worlds universities were chosen. \n",
    "#### General Research Question is:\n",
    "_Considering all 1000 universities from QS World Rankings 2021, is there a significant difference in average international student ratios between universities from the US, Europe and rest of the World?_\n",
    "#### About the data:\n",
    "Initial webpage consists of table of the universities, and while parsing, the program required to go thought the link of that university and retrieve the data from there. As expected, all universities' pages were aligned in the same structure, although not all of them had all the information. Since, to answer the research question some of the variables such as number of total students, number of international students were crucial, program skipped the universities where these values were missing. \n",
    "#### Sampling of the data\n",
    "In the link above, by default, only 25 universities per list will be shown. However it can be set to show 200 universities per page. A get_data.py code imitates some actions, such as opening dropdown menu and selecting to show 200 items per page. Then, program transfers to the next 200 universities again by imitation of the clicking. In similar way, it is possible to access all the 1000 universities presented in the ranking list.\n",
    "<br>Since, retrieving all 1000 universities from the list is time consuming, only a sample of those universities were parsed and processed. _Clustering_ method were used for sampling - 50 randomly selected universities were selected from each group of 200. Ex: 50 universities from each group of 1-200, 201-400, 401-600, 601-800, 801-1000 ranked intitutions were sampled. In this way, it was ensured that sample will contain universities from each ranking division. \n",
    "<br>My running of the get_data.py code resulted in 229 sample size, rather than expected 250, because as it was mentioned, some universities were skipped if they do not contain the specific variables' info. In dataset 17 variables were recorded. Some of the variables contain _categorical data_ (ex: Name, Country), _continuous numerical data_ (ex: Overall Score, Employer Reputation) and _discrete numerical values_ (ex: Total Students, Academic Faculty Staff)."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "On the basis of the retrieved sample of 229 universities, research question was answered. First and trivial approach was to conduct a _Difference in Population Means_ test. All the required assumptions were verified in order for this test to work properly. Results suggested that while we cannot support the statement about significant difference in the mean ratios of the US and the rest of the world, we have evidence to expect the population of universities of Europe and the rest of the world to have different means. \n",
    "<br> To verify the answer of the RQ, alternative proportion test was conducted. Although, it actually tested a slightly different things, results corresponded to the initial tests results.\n",
    "<br> In addition, to answering the focus question, this notebook also provides an interesting observation met during the work on the project.\n",
    "<br><br> The __reliability__ of the answer and methodology used for the RQ can be furtherly improved by sampling more number of universities. Also, possibly, clustering so that each region will have some minimum number of universities sampled will help the accuracy of the sample statistics. \n",
    "<br><br> The sample of this project gives an information only about the universities listed in the QS rankings, which cannon be generalized to the whole universities population. If to continue this work further, I would use another ranking datasets too. Also, I encountered the problem of unstability of the QS webpages. They have thrown some errors randomly sometimes, taking a lot of time to start from the beginning. I would use another Times Higher Education Ranking instead. And finally, I really wanted to come with the question of real importance to me, but available data and, possibly, lack of imagination did not allowed to do so. So, I would spend some more time on thinking about research question that is more interesting and helpful.\n"
